## Variable declaration, val vs var, null safety, const, lateinit, lazy, visibility modifiers, open

1. What is the difference between `var` and `val` in Kotlin?  
2. What is the difference between `val` and `const`, since both are used for immutability?  
3. When do we use the not-null assertion operator (`!!`) in Kotlin?  
4. What is the default data type of a variable in Kotlin when the type is not explicitly specified?  
5. How do we declare a variable as a nullable type in Kotlin?  
6. What is the use of the `internal` and `protected` modifiers in Kotlin?  
7. What is the purpose of the `open` keyword in Kotlin?  
8. Can a `private` class also be declared as `open` in Kotlin?  
9. Can we declare a class as `protected` in Kotlin?  
10. What keyword do we use to override members in a subclass in Kotlin?  
11. Can we override protected members using the `open` keyword?  
12. Can static members be overridden in a subclass?  
13. If I don't know the value of a variable at the time of object creation, how can I initialize it later in Kotlin?  
14. Can we use primitive types with `lateinit` in Kotlin?  
15. What exception is thrown if we access a `lateinit` variable before it is initialized?  
16. Is a `lateinit` variable mutable or immutable in Kotlin?  
17. How can we simulate the behavior of `lateinit` in Java?  
18. Why do we use the `lazy` keyword in Kotlin?  
19. In which use cases do we typically use lazy initialization in Kotlin?  
20. Can we reassign a value to a `lazy` variable in Kotlin?  
21. How can we simulate the behavior of `lazy` in Java?  
22. How is the `lazy` function implemented internally in Kotlin?  
23. What is the return type of the `lazy` function in Kotlin?  
24. What does the `by` keyword return in a lazy declaration?

## Lambda, High Order Functions, Object, Companion Object, Inline, Crossinline, Noinline, Data Class

1. Why do we use lambdas in Kotlin?  
2. What are functional interfaces?  
3. How can we write a lambda using a functional interface?  
4. What are higher-order functions?  
5. What is an object in Kotlin?  
6. What design pattern does `object` follow in Kotlin?  
7. What is a companion object?  
8. How do we use static members in Kotlin?  
9. What is the difference between an `object` and a `companion object`?  
10. Why do we use inline functions?  
11. How can we prevent lambdas from being inlined?  
12. How can we avoid using the `return` statement inside lambdas?  
13. What is a data class?  
14. What methods are generated by a data class?  
15. Can data classes inherit from other classes?  
16. Can we override `equals()` or `hashCode()` in a data class?  
17. What is `copy()` used for in a data class?
